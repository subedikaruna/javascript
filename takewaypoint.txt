Day 1 :
    Js is a single threaded synchronous language.

    data
        1,2,3,4 =>number
        "nitan","ram","a" =>string
        true,false =>boolean
        Note:anything that is coated in ""is string example :"1" is also string here


        Guess the output
        console.log("1"+"1")="1"
console.log(1+"1")="11"//here string wins so we take string 
console.log(1+1+"1"+1+1)="2111"
(2+"1"+1+1)=("21"+1+1)=("211"+1)="2111"
(2+"3"+2+1)="2321"



Day 3
    ()=>paranthesis
    {}=>curly braces or block
    []=>array

we cannot use single quote in single quote and back tick

we can call variable inside ``using ${} but it is not possible in double or single quote
    function
        it has two parts:
             function definition
            function call
            we must call function to run code inside function
        it is not necessary to have same number of argument and parameter
        //func without return call normally i.e.sum()
       //func with return call by storing it in variable  i.e. let s=sum()

        js can return only one value
        by default function will return with undefined value
         
         map methos
         use map method if input is array,output is array and output length is same as input length
         map method modify input element
